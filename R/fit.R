#' Fit linear models to infer objects
#'
#' @description
#' 
#' Given the output of an infer core function, this function will fit
#' a model according to the formula and data supplied earlier in the
#' pipeline. If passed the output of [specify()] or [hypothesize()], the
#' function will fit one model. If passed the output of [generate()],
#' it will fit a model to each data resample, denoted in the `replicate` column.
#'
#' Learn more in `vignette("infer")`.
#'
#' @param x Output from an infer function---likely [generate()] or 
#' [hypothesize()]---which specifies the formula and data to fit a model to.
#  Should likely be an engine param here.
#' @param ... Currently ignored.
#'
#' @return 
#' A tibble. If the input had not been passed to [generate()], the tibble
#' will contain `term` and `stat` columns. If it had been, there will also
#' be a `replicate` column.
#' 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `replicate`: Only supplied if the input object had been previously
#'   passed to [generate()]. A number corresponding to which resample of the
#'   original data set the model was fitted to.
#'   \item `term`: The explanatory variable (or intercept) in question.
#'   \item `stat`: The model coefficient for the given resample (`replicate`) and 
#'   explanatory variable (`term`).
